## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Shortcuts app
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Spotify desktop app installed
- Spotify Developer account (free)

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhrai2811/siri_spotify_link.git
cd siri_spotify_link
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Spotify Developer Setup

1. **Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)**
2. **Click "Create App"**
3. **Fill in app details**:
   - App Name: `Siri Voice Control` (or any name)
   - App Description: `Voice control for Spotify`
   - Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback`
   - Which API/SDKs: `Web API`
4. **Save your app**
5. **Copy your credentials**:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret

### Step 4: Configure Script

Open `spotify_voice.py` and update your credentials:

```python
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
redirect_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback"  # Keep this as-is
```

### Step 5: Create macOS Shortcut

1. **Open Shortcuts app** on your Mac
2. **Click the "+" to create new shortcut**
3. **Add these actions in order**:

   **Action 1: "Dictate Text"**
   - Search for "Dictate Text" and add it
   - This will capture your voice input
   
   **Action 2: "Run Shell Script"** 
   - Search for "Run Shell Script" and add it
   - Configure as follows:
     - **Shell**: `/bin/bash`
     - **Pass Input**: `as arguments`
     - **Script**: 
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/spotify_siri && source .venv/bin/activate && python siri_spotify_link/spotify_voice.py "$@"
     ```
     
     ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace `/path/to/spotify_siri`** with your actual parent directory path. For example:
     ```bash
     cd /Users/prolevelnoob/CodePlayground/prsnl/spotify_siri && source .venv/bin/activate && python siri_spotify_link/spotify_voice.py "$@"
     ```

4. **Configure Siri Phrase**:
   - Click the settings icon in your shortcut
   - Add to Siri with a **unique, short phrase** that won't conflict with Siri commands
   - **Recommended phrases**: 
     - Your initials (e.g., "BJ", "AK", "SM")
     - A unique word (e.g., "Jam", "Vibe", "Tune")
     - A short code (e.g., "SP", "MX", "DJ")
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **AVOID these phrases**:
   - ‚ùå Anything with "Spotify" (triggers "Spotify hasn't added support")
   - ‚ùå "Play" or "Music" (conflicts with Apple Music)
   - ‚ùå "Run" or "Go" (may launch apps or maps)
   - ‚ùå Common commands like "Search", "Find", "Open"

5. **Name your shortcut**:
   - Give it any name you like (e.g., "Audio Control", "Voice DJ", etc.)
   - The name doesn't affect functionality

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Permission denied" error**
```bash
chmod +x spotify_voice.py
```

**‚ùå "Spotify hasn't added support with Siri"**
- Your Siri phrase conflicts with built-in commands
- Try a different phrase like "Find song" or "Music search"

**‚ùå "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'spotipy'"**
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall: `pip install spotipy`

**‚ùå Opens in web player instead of desktop app**
- Make sure Spotify desktop app is installed and running
- The script will auto-fallback to web if desktop isn't available

### First-Time Setup
- You'll need to authenticate with Spotify on first run
- A browser window will open for OAuth authorization
- Click "Agree" to grant permissions
